# secure-sw-dev-videos

This repository contains the supporting videos for
the "Secure Software Development Fundamentals Courses"
aka the "Developing Secure Software" course, which is
[available as a separate repository](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals).

Videos tend to be larger files.
In some cases, when using git push, you may see an error like this:

> *Git push failing HTTP 500 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 500 Internal Server Error*

To solve this,
increase the Git buffer size to the largest individual file size of your repo:

> git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400
