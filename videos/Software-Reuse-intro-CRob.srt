When developing software today, normally, we don't develop everything from scratch, we typically reuse a lot of software.

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,900
And in fact, on average, software products are mostly reused software.

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:34,800
In this chapter, we describe how to reuse software with security in mind, including selecting, downloading, installing, and updating such software.

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,363
Reusing more secure software generally produces more secure results.
