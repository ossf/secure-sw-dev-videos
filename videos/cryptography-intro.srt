[David Wheeler]: This chapter describes the basics of how to use cryptography to help develop secure software.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:15,720
Developing secure software involves a lot more than cryptography, but many secure systems depend vitally on cryptography.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,203
So to have secure systems, we often need to know how to correctly use cryptography.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:33,239
We will cover the basics of symmetric or shared key encryption algorithms, cryptographic hashes, public key or asymmetric encryption,

5
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:42,423
how to securely store passwords, cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators, CSPRNGs, and Transport Layer Security, TLS.
