[David Wheeler]: A key part of implementing secure software is to only accept input that should be accepted.

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:15,438
This chapter describes how to validate input, including how to validate numbers and text, the importance of minimizing attack surfaces,

00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:19,152
and how to improve availability by considering the inputs.

00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:25,473
Limiting input won't counter every attack, but it will tend to make the software harder to attack.
